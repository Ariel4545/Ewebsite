Egon calc is a set of different calculators using Tkinter.
the Egon calcs are pretty basic in use but they contain
some settings about the style and functionality.
the available calculators are:
1. Egon Calc
2. Egon Scientific Calc
3. Egon Base Calc
in addition, the calcs have regular and remastered versions;
the main differences are that the remastered version has a better UI
and that the support was shifted to the remastered for the few
updates that came after the release of it
